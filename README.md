# Project 1: Wordle!

This project has you recreating the popular Wordle game! Follow along with the posted guide and achieve the specified milestones one at a time. Not all of them will eventually be necessary to the final functioning game, but they give you an excellent way to check that you understand what is happening and that your code up to that point is working properly.
